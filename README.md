# digirc
This is just a little for-fun IRC bot that I built; it's fairly hard-coded at the moment so I don't expect it to be useful for anyone else except as a reference for the time being.

It's built in such a way that doing `#reload` in chat will have it recompile the backend, so that spammy join-leave messages are not needed.
